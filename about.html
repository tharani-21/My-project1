Adding the newest and best technology to your store and watching customers scoop it up, thinking about what they’re going to accomplish with it, imagining their happy faces when they open the box — how can you not grin at that?
     Still, it’s a challenge to get your store to the point where you’re selling online to enough of those happy customers. There are a lot of things you can do to market your electronics or spread the word about your shop, but sometimes it all comes down to adding more helpful content.
      <br>There are a few basic pages that you can add to your consumer electronics store to drive more interest, increase purchases, and boost customer happiness. You might already have some of these pages, in fact! But some of them might be brand new to you, and worth pulling into your lineup.
       Let’s take a look at the pages we recommend for electronics stores, and how a few real WooCommerce stores are using them in awesome and interesting ways.
       Whether you’re selling electronics of your own design or distributing products manufactured by someone else, one thing is certain: there’s a lot of competition out there. You need to find ways to stand out and convince customers that it’s you they should buy from, not some other seller.
       Potential customers will often consult these kinds of pages to find out why they should buy from you and not a large retailer or direct competitor. If you can offer even one compelling argument for your store and its products, you’re well on your way to making a sale.
